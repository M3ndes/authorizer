# Development

Below is what was used in the development of this project:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) - PHP is a free interpreted language, originally used only for the development of server-side applications;
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.;
